            <h2 class="text-center">Planning</h2>
            <p class="text-center">Contrary to popular belief, much planning usually goes into the robot, whether it be drawing up the plans for the arm, or how much battery is being consumed at any one time; Planning has to be there every step of the way before anything can get done. Some plans for our robot start as primitive as this:</p>

            </div>
            <p class="text-center">However no matter the planning big or small, all is taken into account and put forth in a way that benefits the team.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-center">Building</h2>
            <div class="text-center" style="padding-bottom: 20px">

            </div>
            <p class="text-center">Once our builders get the plans for the robot, building can commence. For our builders we will often use equipment at our school's workshop however so for the most part, tools are never short. We will carefully plan each part that goes on the robot and quickly determine each and every piece that is necessary, and those pieces will be cut then applied accordingly to our robot.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-center">Notebook</h2>
            <!-- TODO(kiecker): Finish! -->
            <p class="text-center">For the Augusta High School Robotics team, the Notebook was the biggest and most important part of the competition, in fact most of our time was spent making sure the notebook was up to par with the high standards set by the team. The Notebook team consists of 4 people, who will rigorously work to collect data necessary for the Notebook to capture and write it down.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-center">Programming</h2>
            <!-- TODO(all): find a more on topic picture for programming -->
            <div class="text-center" style="padding-bottom: 20px">

            </div>
            
            <p class="text-center">The programming team for Augusta High School consisted of 3 people. All three of which worked vigorously on the robot program to keep it free of bugs while at the same time keeping maximum readability in the code. The program for the robot was designed with RobotC and debugged with not only a test bed but also Simulink graciously provided by B.E.S.T. robotics.</p>
