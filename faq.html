                <p class="text-center">Sadly most people like some of us when we got into robotics believed that we would all be building a robot without any planning and/or supervision; Needless to say, we were dead wrong. Building a robot however takes time and planning, lots of it!</p>
                

                <h2 class="text-center">What do we do?</h2>
                <p class="text-center">When people think of building a robot they often think of a factory or a bunch of geniuses that sit around and just assemble a robot; This couldn't be farther from the truth. What happens in the process of building a robot is often very complex and involves heavy amounts of planning. As well as a diverse group of individuals other than those who build the robot. There are those who have to plan everything out, the engineers that have to do all the complex math while still making sure that all requirements are met. And even programmers that have to program the robot to run and even this very website. And as a diverse group that we are, there are still many more skills required for this huge task ahead.</p>
                
                <h2 class="text-center">Who are we?</h2>
                <p class="text-center">We are a group of various individuals from Augusta High School that enjoy to work together as a team to collaborate and create some cool stuff for our school. </p>
                
                <h2 class="text-center">Sounds fun, how do I join?</h2>
                <p class="text-center">Easy, just show up and ask your robotics instructor</p>
